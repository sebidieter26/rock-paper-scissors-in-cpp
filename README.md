# rock-paper-scissors-in-cpp
A C++ text-based rock, paper and scissors game

I have created this program to practice the switch case function and classes in C++

Summary of the program :
A. I have created 4 functions in MyClass : 

  1. The first function is the player pick function,where the user has to choose between 3 string type variables : rock, paper or scissors. The choice is made by writting down a number from 1 to 3. If the input is not in the range mentioned before or has a different type(e.g. the user writes down "rock"), the program closes.

  2. The second function attributes a random number from 1 to 3, that is calculated in the third function, to the CPU(user's opponent).
     
  3. The third function calculates a random value each time the program is running.
     
  4. The last function is comparing both user's and cpu's values and chooses a winner, or prints out "Draw !" if the values are equal.

B. I have created an object in the main function and then I called the 4 functions from the MyClass class
